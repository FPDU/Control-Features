</h2>

<h3>
<a id="device-control" class="anchor" href="#device-control" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Device control</strong>
</h3>

<p>How much control you will have over moving the prosthesis fingers and wrist. New prostheses may have different types of control:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to open and close a grasp</li>
<li>Ability to use different types of grasps by manually selecting the type. For example, you might squeeze your muscles two times to select a grasp to pick up a cup.</li>
<li>Ability to control three different types of grasps intuitively. Making each grasp would feel like using an intact hand.</li>
<li>Ability to control individual fingers and wrist. Moving each finger and the wrist would feel like using an intact hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="recalibration-frequency" class="anchor" href="#recalibration-frequency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Recalibration frequency</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may need to run a program so the prosthesis understands your intended movements. Some new prostheses may need to be recalibrated once per day or less. Other new prostheses may need to be recalibrated twice per day or more.</p>

<h3>
<a id="time-between-intention-to-move-and-actual-movement" class="anchor" href="#time-between-intention-to-move-and-actual-movement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Time between intention to move and actual movement</strong>
</h3>

<p>For some new prostheses, you will not notice a delay between when you want the prosthesis to move and when it moves. For some new prostheses, there may be a delay that is slightly noticeable. For some new prostheses, the delay might be as long as 2 seconds.</p>

<h3>
<a id="speed-once-movement-has-started" class="anchor" href="#speed-once-movement-has-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Speed, once movement has started</strong>
</h3>

<p>How fast the prosthesis will move. With some new prostheses, you may be able to perform tasks as quickly as with an intact hand. For other new prostheses, you will perform tasks more slowly. It may take as long as 10 times the time it takes to do something with an intact hand.</p>

<h3>
<a id="precision" class="anchor" href="#precision" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Precision</strong>
</h3>

<p>How precisely you can control the prosthesis fingers. Some new prostheses may be precise enough to remove a stem from a cherry without squishing the cherry. Some new prostheses may be precise enough to type on a computer keyboard with the fingers. Some new prostheses may be precise enough to type on a smaller cellphone keyboard with the fingers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="visual-attention-needed" class="anchor" href="#visual-attention-needed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Visual attention needed</strong>
</h3>

<p>Most current prosthesis users must always watch their prostheses while they are using them to do something. You may be able to use some of the new prostheses without always watching them.  You may be able to do this because you will feel where the prosthesis is positioned.</p>

<h3>
<a id="training-time" class="anchor" href="#training-time" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Training time</strong>
</h3>

<p>It may take you some time to learn to use the new prostheses. It may take you as little as one week to become comfortable using some of the new prostheses. It may take you as long as two months to become comfortable using some others.</p>
